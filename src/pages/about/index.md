### Origins
On March 1st, 2018, 9000 CryptoKitties players were chosen at random to receive an airdrop of 100m AVO tokens each. The reasoning for this was because CK players were recognized as creative, innovative, and positive users of crypto. This action has been dubbed the world's first reverse-ICO, bringing people together to establish a community and collaborate.

Around the time of March 18th the original creator of AVO token suddenly disappeared and took all projects and social media platforms related to AVO with them. They also burned their own supply of the tokens, reducing the number from 100 trillion to 900 billion that are now in circulation.

The community that had assembled had to ask: what do we do with our AVO? It would seem that the creator of this token, whoever they are, has left it up to us to decide.

## The Present
We are still trying to reach as many of the airdrop recipients as possible. It is likely that many still do not realise they have been gifted the tokens. Our community continues to grow slowly and we hope to accelerate it's growth as we create useful applications for AVO.

### The Future
We have many ideas to give Avocado Token utility and maybe even value! We hope you can join us to make it happen.
